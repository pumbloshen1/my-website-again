    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Motaz Abo Hadwan. I was born on October 15, 2008, in Palestine / Israel. 
      At 15 years old, I have a deep passion for technology, particularly in the areas of computer programming and building. 
      Since a young age, I have been fascinated by how things work, especially computers. This curiosity has driven me to learn more 
      about the intricate details of technology and how I can leverage it to create innovative solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am an avid anime fan, and my favorite series include 'Classroom of the Elite' and 'The Quintessential Quintuplets.' 
      These shows not only provide entertainment but also inspire me with their complex characters and intriguing storylines. 
      Anime has a unique way of blending art and storytelling, which I find incredibly captivating.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to my interests in tech and anime, I am committed to continuously improving my skills and knowledge. 
      Whether it's through building my own projects or studying the latest advancements in technology, I am always eager to learn and grow.

    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <p>
      Looking ahead, I have several ambitious goals. One of my primary objectives is to open a computer store where I can share my 
      passion for technology with others and help them find the best solutions for their needs. I also aspire to become a proficient 
      programmer and PC builder. By mastering these skills, I hope to contribute to the tech community and create innovative products 
      that make a difference in people's lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, my dream is to establish my own tech company. I envision a company that not only provides cutting-edge technology 
      solutions but also fosters a culture of creativity and innovation. I believe that with hard work, dedication, and a willingness 
      to learn, I can achieve these goals and make a positive impact on the world.
